# Demo Trained Models

Since our trained models contain intermediate data that allows you to train it further with new corpora, their sizes are larger than the size GitHub LFS is willing to handle.

Therefore we put them on Google Drive:

[Google Drive shared folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B28rFtb9-7L7SzRFY19pNVVidG8?usp=sharing)

## Instruction

1. Download all the files inside the [shared folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B28rFtb9-7L7SzRFY19pNVVidG8?usp=sharing).
	-  **(Recommended)**
	Run `python download.py`. Sit and relax.
	-  (Alternative) Manually download all the files in the shared folder and rename them to `demo.*`.
2. Now it should work with the default configuration.

## Change Log

Note that we may continuously refine our demo model. All the changes will be available on the [shared folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B28rFtb9-7L7SzRFY19pNVVidG8?usp=sharing) immediately and we will keep a log here for your reference.
